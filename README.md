# MinHeap
Converts values in a given text file into a Min Heap

The purpose of this program is to take values from a file, and sort them into a min heap
The first line in the text file should contain the number of values (Eg: if the values are "4 5 3 2 1", then the first line should be 5)
The Second line should contain the actual values wished to be converted into a min heap. eg: "4 5 3 2 1"
The program will output the number of swaps it took to convert the values into a min heap, the locations of each swapped value, as well as the time it took for the algorithm to run
